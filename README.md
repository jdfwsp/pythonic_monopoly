#### This is an analysis of rentals in the neighborhoods in San Francisco, CA.  It examines the average price per square foot and gross rent in every neighborhood over a 5-year period.  The first notebook works out all of the analysis:
[Rental Anlysis](https://github.com/jdfwsp/pythonic_monopoly/blob/main/Starter_Code/rental_analysis.ipynb)

#### This second notebook organizes the analysis code so that it can be displayed in a Panel presentation:
[Dashboard](https://github.com/jdfwsp/pythonic_monopoly/blob/main/Starter_Code/dashboard.ipynb)

## Procedure for viewing the presentation:
### Step 1
```
git clone https://github.com/jdfwsp/pythonic_monopoly.git
```
### Step 2
```
cd pythonic_monopoly/Starter_Code
```
### Step 3
```
ls -l run.sh
```
You should get an output like this with ``run.sh`` marked as executable (with an x)- proceed to Step 4
```

-rwxrwxr-x 1 wh wh      27 May 20 12:14 run.sh
```
If you see this, it is NOT executable- proceed to Step 3+
```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 wh wh      27 May 20 12:14 run.sh
```
### Step 3+
```
chmod +x run.sh
```
### Step 4
```
./run.sh
```
### Step 5
Paste ``http://localhost:5006/dashboard`` into your browser and explore the Dashboard!!
